**Please note that this project is not to present front end skills and styling per se, but is to practice some basic elements. In other words: the app looks quite terrible.**

Some basic crud operations with Spring Boot and Angular, main focus with tests, json and Spring Security.

## About
Main objective is with combining Spring Security with Angular, and tests. 

User can add new todos with title and content, get them as as list, modify them and delete. So basic crud yes :)

For futere reference.

## Road map
I'll be building the app peace at a time as follows:
### Backend
Spring Boot
- Basic CRUD operations with controller, and service layer.
- Tests
- Spring Security
    with in-mem user
- Tests with Spring Security

### Front end
Angular
- CRUD operations
- With authentication
