Some basic crud operations with Spring Boot and Angular, main focus with tests, json and Spring Security.

**Please note that this project is not to present front end skills and styling per se, but is to practice some basic elements. In other words: the app looks quite terrible.**



## About
Main objective is with combining Spring Security with Angular, and tests. 

User can add new todos with title and content, get them as as list, modify them and delete. So basic crud yes :)

For futere reference.
